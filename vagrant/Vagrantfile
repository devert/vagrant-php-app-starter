  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,

  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example, to change memory and 
    # allow symlinks to be created in the shared folder:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
    vb.customize ["setextradata", :id, "VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/proj-name", "1"]
  end

  # information on available options.
